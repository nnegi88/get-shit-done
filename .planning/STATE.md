## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Tests before code changes -- characterization tests capture current behavior so refactoring can be validated
- [Roadmap]: Error handling before decomposition -- error classes and validation must exist before modules are extracted
- [Roadmap]: ERRH-04 (verbose flag) grouped with DEVX phase -- it is a developer experience feature, not an error handling foundation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Primary risk is breaking the installer during refactoring -- installer tests in Phase 1 mitigate this
- [Research]: Regex hardening may change matching behavior -- characterization tests in Phase 1 provide safety net
